# 360_Bangkok

This study involved collecting panoramic videos using a GoPro Max camera mounted on a helmet while riding a motorcycle from December 18, 2022, to January 16, 2023. The camera was set to 360 video mode with 5.6k resolution and 30 Frames per second. The journeys mostly covered the route from home in the Phaya Thai district to Chulalongkorn University in central Bangkok, as indicated by the green dots on the map with examples of captured scenes in Figure 1 (left) with an example of object detection (right). It is important to note that these journeys were routine activities and did not put the user at increased risk. The study obtained ethics approval from UCL and Chulalongkorn University. The dataset is the 360-view of street scenes from a motorcyclist’s helmet across Bangkok’s streets during diverse times of day, including peak and off-peak periods on weekdays and weekends.
